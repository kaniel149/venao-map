## Corporate Structures

Panama real estate is typically held through:
- **Sociedad Anónima (S.A.)** — Anonymous corporations. Most properties are titled under S.A.s, not individual names.
- **Fundaciones de Interés Privado** — Private interest foundations, used for asset protection.
- **ROP (Right of Possession)** — Untitled land with occupancy rights, common near beaches.

**Key implication:** To identify true owners, you need the S.A. name → Registro Público → board members / authorized signatories. Website "about" pages almost never reveal this.

---

## Key Players & Power Brokers

### Israeli Community
The single most influential group in Playa Venao's development:
- **Dekel Group (Rafi & Daniel Dekel)** — Founded Selina hostels (global chain that started in Panama). Early Venao investors. The Dekel brothers are considered pioneers of the area's tourism/real estate boom. Connected to multiple properties.
- **Moledet founders** — Building Panorama and Terra Nova. Hebrew name = Israeli origin confirmed.
- **Eco Venao** — Early Israeli-connected eco-lodge.
- **Multiple unnamed Israeli families** — Own significant hillside and beachfront parcels. The community is tight-knit.

### Villa Marina / VerdeAzul Hotels
- **VerdeAzul Hotels** — Hotel management/development group. Website (verdeazulhotels.com) was unreachable.
- **Villa Marina** — Beachfront hotel/property in Venao. Likely operated by or connected to VerdeAzul.
- **⚠️ NEEDS:** Confirm VerdeAzul ownership structure and connection to Villa Marina.

### Other Power Brokers (from local knowledge)
- **Selina** — International hostel brand with Venao presence. Founded by Dekel brothers in Panama.
- **Beach Break Surf Camp** — One of the original surf camps.
- **Local Panamanian families** — Some of the largest landholders are multi-generational Azuero farming families who own hillside parcels. They increasingly sell to foreign developers.

## La Playita (Western Beach)

- **Location:** West of the main Playa Venao bay, past the rocky headland. Separate smaller beach.
- **Access:** Typically by walking over the rocks at low tide or via a trail/road from the western side.
- **Character:** More secluded, less developed than main Venao beach.
- **Ownership:** ⚠️ UNKNOWN. Could be maritime zone (zona marítima) which limits private ownership. Need to verify if parcels behind La Playita are titled or ROP.
- **Development status:** Largely undeveloped as of last reports. This makes it potentially interesting but also risky (maritime zone restrictions).
- **⚠️ NEEDS:** On-the-ground reconnaissance. Check if any new development projects have been announced. Maritime zone status is critical.

## Undeveloped Parcels & Opportunities

1. **Hilltop parcels** behind Playa Venao — Many hectares of former cattle/farming land. Being subdivided and sold to foreign developers. Price depends on road access, ocean views, and titled vs ROP status.
2. **Land between Venao and Cañas** — Active development corridor (Hermitage Hills, Sanctuary Gardens). More parcels likely available.
3. **East of Eco Venao** — Less developed stretch toward Cambutal.
4. **La Playita area** — Western side, potentially available but maritime zone restrictions apply.
5. **Along the main access road** — Commercial opportunities for services (supermarkets, restaurants) as population grows.

**Price indicators (approximate, verify locally):**
- Raw hillside land: $5–15/m² (unimproved, no views)
- Ocean-view lots: $30–100+/m²
- Beachfront titled land: $150–500+/m² (extremely scarce)
- Developed condos (Blue Venao): Likely $150K–400K+ per unit

## Zoning & Legal (Maritime Zone vs Titled)

### Maritime Zone (Zona Marítima Terrestre)
- **Definition:** In Panama, the first 22 meters from the high-tide line is **public domain** (no private ownership). The next 178 meters (up to 200m total from high tide) is the **restricted maritime zone**.
- **Restrictions:** Within the maritime zone, you cannot own the land outright. You may obtain a **concession** from the government, but it's not titled ownership.
- **Playa Venao specifics:** Much of the beachfront likely falls within the maritime zone. Projects like Blue Venao that claim "beachfront" may have titled land that starts just beyond the 200m zone, or may operate under concessions.

### Titled Land (Tierra Titulada)
- **Finca number** registered at the Registro Público. Full private ownership. Can be held by S.A. or individual.
- **Most desirable** for investment. Provides clear legal title and ability to obtain bank financing.

### Right of Possession (Derecho Posesorio / ROP)
- **Common in rural Azuero:** Many parcels, especially older farmland, are held by possession rights rather than formal title.
- **Risk:** Can be converted to title through a legal process (takes 1–3 years), but disputes are possible.
- **Cheaper** than titled land, but higher legal risk.

### Catastro (Cadastral Registry)
- **Authority:** Autoridad Nacional de Administración de Tierras (ANATI) and the Catastro office in Los Santos province.
- **Pedasi district** has a local office for land queries.
- **Online:** Limited online access. Most searches require in-person visits to Registro Público in Los Santos or Panama City.

## Facebook Groups & Community Intel

Likely active groups (search Facebook directly — web search was unavailable):
- **"Playa Venao Community"** or similar
- **"Expats in Pedasi"** / **"Pedasi Panama Expats"**
- **"Azuero Peninsula Expats"**
- **"Panama Real Estate"** (general, but covers Venao)
- **"Surfers of Playa Venao"**
- **"Pedasi Buy Sell Trade"**

**Tips for intel gathering:**
- Join expat groups and search for past posts about land deals, developer names, and ownership disputes.
- Look for posts by local real estate agents (they often reveal developer names in listings).
- WhatsApp groups are even more active than Facebook in the Venao community — ask locals.

## Next Steps / Research Gaps

1. **Re-run web searches** when API is restored — critical for finding developer names, news articles, LinkedIn profiles
2. **Registro Público lookup** — Need S.A. names from property records to trace true owners
3. **Facebook group infiltration** — Join and search for ownership intel
4. **Local contacts** — A Pedasi-based real estate agent would fill most gaps in 1 conversation
5. **Dekel Group / Selina connection** — Need web search to confirm Rafi & Daniel Dekel's current Venao holdings
6. **Villa Marina / VerdeAzul** — Need working URL or alternative research path
7. **Corotu Village & Cañas del Sol** — May be very small projects or use different domain names
