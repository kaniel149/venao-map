## 3. Villa Marina

**Status:** ⚠️ Limited information found. No dedicated website located (villamarinaplayavenao.com does not resolve).
- Instagram handle @villamarina_venao exists but content could not be scraped.
- **Needs:** On-the-ground intel, Facebook group posts, or broker contacts for ownership info.
- **Hypothesis:** Likely a smaller boutique development by a different (possibly Latin American) developer. May be visible on real estate listing sites.

---

## 4. Hermitage Hills

**Status:** ⚠️ The domain hermitagehills.com resolves to a Baptist church in Hermitage, Tennessee — NOT the Panama development.
- Search was rate-limited before finding the correct entity.
- **Needs:** Correct URL or local broker intel. Try searching "Hermitage Hills Venao" on Facebook groups or real estate platforms.

---

## 5. Eco Venao

**Type:** Eco-lodge and reforestation project
- **Website:** ecovenao.com
- **Location:** "Quiet side of Playa Venao" — western/hillside area
- **Founded:** Permaculture project since May 2015
- **Ownership:** Reported to be French-owned (per task brief). Website does not explicitly name owners.
- **Operations:** Hostel, restaurant ("Up at the Jungle"), coffee shop ("El Cafe de Acá"), beach bar ("La Barca"), permaculture tours, turtle nursery, yoga retreats, horseback riding.
- **Pricing:** $15–$250/night depending on accommodation type.
- **Needs:** French owner names — check TripAdvisor reviews, LinkedIn, or Panama corporate registry for "Eco Venao" entity.

---

## 6. Moledet (Israeli Community)

**Status:** ⚠️ Search engines were rate-limited/blocked before results could be obtained.
- **"Moledet"** is Hebrew for "homeland" — significant name choice for a community development.
- **Hypothesis:** Given the strong Israeli developer presence (Dekel Holdings), Moledet may be an informal name for a community/neighborhood within or adjacent to the broader Venao/Pedasi Israeli expat cluster.
- **Needs:** Facebook group "Israelis in Panama," local broker contacts, or direct search on panamaempresas.com for "Moledet" entity.

---

## 7. La Playita

**Status:** ⚠️ Could not retrieve search results due to rate limiting.
- La Playita is the western beach past the rocky headland from main Playa Venao.
- **Needs:** Cadastral records, local broker intel, or satellite imagery analysis to identify parcel boundaries and owners.

---

## 8. Panama Cadastral Records & Registry Tools

**Registro Público de Panamá:**
- Corporate search: **panamaempresas.com** (third-party aggregator of public Registro Público data) — EXCELLENT resource for looking up corporate entities, directors, attorneys-in-fact.
- Official: registro-publico.gob.pa (not tested)
- **Catastro (land registry):** catastro.mef.gob.pa — domain did NOT resolve (may be internal/VPN only, or restructured).
- **Strategy:** Search by known names (Landau, Rudasevski, Dekel) on panamaempresas.com to map the full corporate web. Daniel Rudasevski alone is linked to **108 companies** — this is the thread to pull.

---

## 9. Facebook Groups

**Not scraped** (requires browser login). Recommended groups to monitor:
- "Playa Venao Real Estate"
- "Pedasi Real Estate"
- "Expats in Pedasi"
- "Israelis in Panama"
- "Panama Real Estate Investors"

---

## 10. Land Prices

**Status:** ⚠️ Could not retrieve pricing data from web search.
- **Blue Venao reference:** 160 units, 99–450 m², beachfront gated community. Based on comparable Panama beach developments, estimated range: $1,500–$3,500/m² for finished condos.
- **Andromeda Pedasi:** 237 lots, 700–2,500 m². Raw/improved lot prices likely $50–$150/m² for lots, higher for finished homes.
- **Needs:** Current listings from compassandtwine.com, puntopanama.com, or direct broker quotes.

## Key Intelligence Threads to Pull

1. **Daniel Rudasevski — 108 companies.** This is the corporate spider web. A deep dive on panamaempresas.com (paid access may be needed) would map the entire Dekel/Israeli development network in Azuero.
2. **Luis Fernando Arauz Candanedo — 61 companies.** The go-to lawyer/resident agent. His other clients likely include additional Venao-area developments.
3. **Eco Venao French owners** — Check TripAdvisor "owner response" names, or LinkedIn search "Eco Venao founder."
4. **Villa Marina & Hermitage Hills** — Need correct URLs or Facebook intel.
5. **Moledet** — Search panamaempresas.com for entity name variations.
